// class <ClassName>
// what is class, class is a keyword (Reserve word), we declare a class
// class name can be same or different if class is not public.
// if class is public so it names must be match with a file.
// class name should be in PascalCase e.g PrintWriter e.g AmitSrivastava
// to compile java program e.g javac <FileName>.java
// after compile we get a Byte Code (.class file), A Byte code file name is same as class name
// to run java code e.g java <ByteCodeFileName/ClassName>
